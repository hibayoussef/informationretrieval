tiddlywebplugins.imaker is a tool to help create new instances.

In TiddlyWeb, an instance is a particular store + configuration
which serves up a set of content and features.

imaker works to ensure that created instances have the expected
initial configuration and (optionally) initial bags, recipes, users
and tiddlers.

imaker replaces the installation half of the functionality 
provided by tiddlywebplugins.instancer. See tiddlywebplugins.ibuilder
for the development half.
